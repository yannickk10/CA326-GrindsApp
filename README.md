# **CA326-GrindsApp (3rd Year Project)**
A Django web app to provide a platform for grinds tutors and students of Junior certificate/Leaving certificate looking for grinds. The aim of this platform is for students of JC/LC level in need of extra academic aid in specific subjects such as Maths, to be able to find a grinds tutor that will help them obtain their desired grade.
The platform will enable both Student and Tutors to log in and from here they will be able to access different aspects of the app.

# **Result**
Overall grade: 71%

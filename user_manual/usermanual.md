**About TutorO**

TutorO is a free to use web app aimed at both Students of 3rd level
education and tutors with the qualifications to teach those students.

The aim of our app was to connect students and tutors on an online
platform which would allow students to get a personalised learning
experience and also allow them to learn from the comfort of their own
homes. This has been seen to be even more important due to the current
ongoing issues in our world at the moment.
